# Security Strategy

This document outlines the security strategy for the Athlete Genesis AI application.

## Security Principles

### Defense in Depth
- Implement multiple layers of security controls
- Assume any single security control can fail
- Design with security at every level

### Least Privilege
- Grant minimal access required for functionality
- Implement role-based access control
- Regularly review and audit permissions

### Secure by Default
- Implement secure defaults for all features
- Require explicit opt-in for risky features
- Disable insecure legacy features

### Privacy by Design
- Collect only necessary data
- Implement data minimization
- Provide user control over their data

## Security Areas

### 1. Authentication and Authorization

#### Authentication
- Implement secure authentication methods
- Support multi-factor authentication
- Enforce strong password policies

#### Authorization
- Implement role-based access control
- Use attribute-based access control for fine-grained permissions
- Validate permissions on both client and server

#### Session Management
- Use secure, HttpOnly, SameSite cookies
- Implement proper session timeout
- Provide session revocation capabilities

### 2. Data Security

#### Data Encryption
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Use TLS for data in transit
- Implement end-to-end encryption where appropriate

#### Data Validation
- Validate all input data
- Implement input sanitization
- Use parameterized queries for database access

#### Sensitive Data Handling
- Identify and classify sensitive data
- Implement data masking for sensitive information
- Provide secure data deletion capabilities

### 3. Frontend Security

#### XSS Prevention
- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Use React's built-in XSS protection
- Sanitize user-generated content

#### CSRF Protection
- Implement anti-CSRF tokens
- Use SameSite cookies
- Validate request origins

#### Secure Configuration
- Remove debug information in production
- Disable developer tools in production
- Implement subresource integrity

### 4. API Security

#### API Authentication
- Use OAuth 2.0 or JWT for API authentication
- Implement API rate limiting
- Validate API tokens on every request

#### Input Validation
- Validate all API inputs
- Implement schema validation
- Reject unexpected parameters

#### Output Filtering
- Filter sensitive data from API responses
- Implement proper error handling
- Avoid exposing implementation details

### 5. Dependency Security

#### Dependency Management
- Regularly update dependencies
- Use dependency scanning tools
- Monitor for security advisories

#### Build Process Security
- Implement secure build processes
- Validate build artifacts
- Use integrity checks for dependencies

### 6. Security Monitoring and Response

#### Security Monitoring
- Implement logging for security events
- Use intrusion detection systems
- Monitor for unusual activity

#### Incident Response
- Develop an incident response plan
- Implement security incident reporting
- Conduct regular security drills

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Security Assessment
1. Conduct security assessment of current application
2. Identify security gaps and vulnerabilities
3. Prioritize security improvements

### Phase 2: Authentication and Authorization
1. Implement secure authentication
2. Develop role-based access control
3. Enhance session management

### Phase 3: Data Security
1. Implement data encryption
2. Enhance input validation
3. Improve sensitive data handling

### Phase 4: Frontend and API Security
1. Implement Content Security Policy
2. Enhance API security
3. Improve CSRF protection

### Phase 5: Monitoring and Response
1. Implement security logging
2. Develop incident response procedures
3. Set up security monitoring

## Security Tools and Libraries

### Authentication and Authorization
- Auth0 or Supabase Auth for authentication
- CASL for authorization
- JWT for secure tokens

### Security Testing
- OWASP ZAP for security testing
- SonarQube for code security analysis
- npm audit for dependency scanning

### Monitoring and Response
- Sentry for error tracking and monitoring
- ELK stack for log analysis
- Cloudflare for DDoS protection

## Security Guidelines for Developers

### Secure Coding Practices
- Follow OWASP Secure Coding Guidelines
- Use security linting tools
- Participate in security code reviews

### Security Testing
- Include security tests in test suite
- Perform security testing before releases
- Report security issues responsibly

### Security Training
- Complete security awareness training
- Stay updated on security best practices
- Participate in security workshops
