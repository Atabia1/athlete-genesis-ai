# TypeScript Migration Plan

This document outlines the plan for gradually enabling strict TypeScript checks in the project.

## Current Status

- [x] `noImplicitAny`: Enabled - Ensures variables have explicit types
- [x] `noImplicitThis`: Enabled - Ensures 'this' references have explicit types
- [x] `strictBindCallApply`: Enabled - Ensures correct types for bind, call, and apply
- [x] `strictFunctionTypes`: Enabled - Ensures function parameter types are checked correctly
- [x] `noUnusedLocals`: Enabled - Ensures all declared variables are used
- [x] `noUnusedParameters`: Enabled - Ensures all function parameters are used
- [x] `noFallthroughCasesInSwitch`: Enabled - Ensures switch cases have break or return statements
- [x] `strictNullChecks`: Enabled - Ensures null and undefined are handled explicitly
- [x] `strictPropertyInitialization`: Enabled - Ensures class properties are initialized
- [x] `alwaysStrict`: Enabled - Ensures 'use strict' is added to every file
- [x] Full `strict: true`: Enabled - All strict type checking options enabled

## Migration Steps

### Phase 1: Initial Strict Checks (Completed)

- Enable `noImplicitAny`, `noImplicitThis`, `strictBindCallApply`, `strictFunctionTypes`
- Enable `noUnusedLocals`, `noUnusedParameters`, `noFallthroughCasesInSwitch`
- Fix all type errors related to these checks

### Phase 2: Null and Undefined Handling (Completed)

- Enable `strictNullChecks`
- Update code to handle null and undefined values explicitly
- Add proper null checks throughout the codebase

### Phase 3: Class Property Initialization (Completed)

- Enable `strictPropertyInitialization`
- Ensure all class properties are properly initialized
- Add definite assignment assertions where needed

### Phase 4: Full Strict Mode (Completed)

- Enable `alwaysStrict`
- Enable full `strict: true` in tsconfig
- Perform final review of the codebase

## Migration Completion

The TypeScript migration to full strict mode has been completed successfully. All strict type checking options are now enabled in the project:

- `strict: true` is set in tsconfig.app.json
- All individual strict flags are explicitly enabled for clarity
- The codebase has been reviewed and passes all TypeScript checks

### Next Steps

While the migration to strict mode is complete, we should continue to:

1. Eliminate any remaining `any` types in the codebase
2. Add comprehensive type definitions for all APIs
3. Improve type documentation with JSDoc comments
4. Consider enabling additional TypeScript flags like `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`

## Benefits

- Catch type-related bugs at compile time rather than runtime
- Improve code quality and maintainability
- Better IDE support and autocompletion
- More reliable refactoring
- Better documentation through types

## Notes for Developers

When working with the codebase during this migration:

1. Always add explicit types to new code
2. When modifying existing code, add types where they're missing
3. Use the TypeScript compiler to identify issues (`npm run tsc`)
4. Don't use `any` type unless absolutely necessary
5. Don't use non-null assertions (`!`) unless you're certain a value can't be null
