# CI/CD Pipeline Strategy

This document outlines the continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) strategy for the Athlete Genesis AI application.

## CI/CD Principles

### Automation
- Automate all repetitive tasks
- Minimize manual intervention
- Ensure reproducible builds

### Fast Feedback
- Provide quick feedback on changes
- Fail fast and early
- Prioritize critical tests

### Quality Gates
- Enforce code quality standards
- Require passing tests
- Implement security scanning

### Traceability
- Track changes through the pipeline
- Link builds to source code
- Document deployment history

## CI/CD Pipeline Stages

### 1. Code Commit

#### Pre-commit Hooks
- Run linting and formatting
- Check for basic errors
- Enforce commit message standards

#### Branch Protection
- Protect main and release branches
- Require pull requests for changes
- Enforce code review requirements

#### Commit Validation
- Validate commit messages
- Check for sensitive information
- Verify file size limits

### 2. Build and Test

#### Code Checkout
- Clone repository
- Set up build environment
- Install dependencies

#### Static Analysis
- Run linting and type checking
- Analyze code quality
- Check for code smells

#### Unit Testing
- Run unit tests
- Generate test coverage reports
- Fail if coverage drops below threshold

#### Integration Testing
- Run integration tests
- Test API interactions
- Verify component integration

### 3. Quality Gates

#### Security Scanning
- Scan for vulnerabilities
- Check dependencies for security issues
- Perform static application security testing (SAST)

#### Accessibility Testing
- Run automated accessibility tests
- Verify WCAG compliance
- Generate accessibility reports

#### Performance Testing
- Run performance tests
- Check bundle size
- Verify performance budgets

#### Code Review
- Require peer code review
- Enforce review standards
- Provide review templates

### 4. Deployment Preparation

#### Environment Configuration
- Generate environment-specific configs
- Set up environment variables
- Prepare deployment artifacts

#### Versioning
- Generate semantic version
- Update version in artifacts
- Tag repository with version

#### Release Notes
- Generate release notes
- Compile changelog
- Document breaking changes

### 5. Deployment

#### Staging Deployment
- Deploy to staging environment
- Run smoke tests
- Verify environment health

#### Production Deployment
- Deploy to production environment
- Implement blue-green or canary deployment
- Monitor deployment progress

#### Post-Deployment Verification
- Run smoke tests in production
- Verify critical functionality
- Monitor for errors

### 6. Monitoring and Feedback

#### Application Monitoring
- Monitor application health
- Track error rates
- Measure performance metrics

#### User Feedback
- Collect user feedback
- Track user-reported issues
- Measure user satisfaction

#### Continuous Improvement
- Analyze pipeline performance
- Identify bottlenecks
- Implement improvements

## CI/CD Tools and Services

### CI/CD Platforms
- GitHub Actions for GitHub repositories
- GitLab CI/CD for GitLab repositories
- Jenkins for self-hosted CI/CD

### Build and Test Tools
- Jest for JavaScript/TypeScript testing
- ESLint for code linting
- TypeScript for type checking

### Deployment Tools
- AWS Amplify for frontend deployment
- Vercel for frontend deployment
- Docker and Kubernetes for containerized deployment

### Monitoring Tools
- Sentry for error tracking
- Datadog for application monitoring
- Lighthouse CI for performance monitoring

## Environment Strategy

### Development Environment
- Used by developers for daily work
- Automatically deployed from feature branches
- Ephemeral environments for pull requests

### Staging Environment
- Mirrors production configuration
- Used for pre-release testing
- Automatically deployed from main branch

### Production Environment
- Serves end users
- Deployed manually or on release tags
- Protected with additional safeguards

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Basic CI Pipeline
1. Set up repository and branch protection
2. Implement linting and testing in CI
3. Configure basic build process

### Phase 2: Enhanced Quality Gates
1. Add security scanning
2. Implement accessibility testing
3. Set up performance testing

### Phase 3: Automated Deployment
1. Configure staging environment deployment
2. Implement deployment preparation
3. Set up post-deployment verification

### Phase 4: Production Deployment
1. Configure production deployment
2. Implement blue-green or canary deployment
3. Set up monitoring and alerting

### Phase 5: Advanced Features
1. Implement feature flags
2. Set up A/B testing infrastructure
3. Enhance monitoring and feedback loops

## CI/CD Guidelines for Developers

### Working with the Pipeline
- Understand pipeline stages and requirements
- Check pipeline status before merging
- Investigate and fix pipeline failures

### Local Development
- Run tests locally before committing
- Use pre-commit hooks
- Match local environment to CI environment

### Deployment Practices
- Follow semantic versioning
- Document changes in release notes
- Verify deployments in staging before production

## Example CI/CD Configuration

### GitHub Actions Workflow

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '16'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Lint code
        run: npm run lint
      - name: Type check
        run: npm run typecheck
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test -- --coverage
      - name: Upload coverage
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v2

  security-scan:
    needs: build-and-test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Security scan
        run: npm audit
      - name: SAST scan
        uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v1

  deploy-staging:
    if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    needs: [build-and-test, security-scan]
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '16'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Build
        run: npm run build:staging
      - name: Deploy to staging
        uses: amondnet/vercel-action@v20
        with:
          vercel-token: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
          vercel-org-id: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_ORG_ID }}
          vercel-project-id: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_PROJECT_ID }}
